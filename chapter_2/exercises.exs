# Build an anonymous function that applies a tax of 12% to a given price. It should print a message with the new price and tax value. Bind the anonymous function to a variable called apply_tax. You should use apply_tax with Enum.each/2, like in the following example. Don’t worry about Enum.each/2 now; you’ll see it in detail in Chapter 5, Using Higher-Order Functions. You only need to know that Enum.each/2 will execute apply_tax in each item of a list.

# Enum.each [12.5, 30.99, 250.49, 18.80], apply_tax
# Price: 14.0 - Tax: 1.5
# Price: 34.7088 - Tax: 3.7188
# Price: 280.5488 - Tax: 30.0588
# Price: 21.056 - Tax: 2.256

apply_tax = fn
  untaxed -> tax = untaxed * 0.12; total = untaxed + tax; IO.puts("Price: #{total} - Tax: #{tax}")
end

Enum.each [12.5, 30.99, 250.49, 18.80], apply_tax


# Create a module called MatchstickFactory and a function called boxes/1. The function will calculate the number of boxes necessary to accommodate some matchsticks. It returns a map with the number of boxes necessary for each type of box. The factory has three types of boxes: the big ones hold fifty matchsticks, the medium ones hold twenty, and the small ones hold five. The boxes can’t have fewer matchstick that they can hold; they must be full. The returning map should contain the remaining matchsticks. It should work like this:
# MatchstickFactory.boxes(98)
# # %{big: 1, medium: 2, remaining_matchsticks: 3, small: 1}
# MatchstickFactory.boxes(39)
# %{big: 0, medium: 1, remaining_matchsticks: 4, small: 3}

# Tip: You’ll need to use the rem/2 and div/2 functions.[13]

    [medium, remaining] = box(remaining, 20)

    output = %{big: big, medium: medium, small: small, remaining_matchsticks: remaining}
    IO.inspect(output)
  end

  def box(matchsticks, box_size) do
    boxed = div(matchsticks, box_size)

    [boxed, remaining]
